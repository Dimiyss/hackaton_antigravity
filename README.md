# AI Fitness Onboarding (Vibe Code) 🚀

An interactive, AI-native onboarding flow designed to maximize subscription conversion through personalized physiological feedback.

## The Mission
To replace static onboarding with an **AI Feedback Loop**. By analyzing user barriers (Order #3) and body types (Order #4/5), the system generates a custom "Vibe" that proves the app understands the user's specific struggle.

## Tech Stack
- **IDE:** Antigravity (AI-native flow)
- **Backend:** FastAPI + SQLAlchemy (SQLite)
- **Intelligence:** ChatGPT API (GPT-4o)
- **Frontend:** TypeScript / Vite

## Onboarding Logic
The flow follows a structured JSON sequence (see `docs/onboarding_flow.md`) that culminates in an `ai_feedback` state. This state uses the user's data to generate a motivation-boosting summary before the paywall.

# Vibe Fitness: Neon AI Onboarding ⚡

A high-conversion fitness onboarding experience using a "Black Neon" aesthetic to drive urgency and premium feel.

## Visual Identity
* **Background:** `#000000` (Pure Black) or `#050505` (Deep Obsidian).
* **Primary Accent:** `#00FF94` (Neon Mint) — Used for "Next" buttons and active states.
* **Secondary Accent:** `#BCFF00` (Electric Lime) — Used for progress bars and AI highlights.
* **Typography:** Inter or Geist Mono (for that technical, "Antigravity" vibe).

## Performance Hooks
* **Interactive JSON Flow:** Dynamic question rendering based on user goals.
* **AI Validation:** Real-time feedback in Step 9 to solve user barriers before the paywall.
